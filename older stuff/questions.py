# Exercise 1
# #####################
# Write a Python program that prints the integers between 1000 and 3000
# that are divisible by both 7 and 13.


# #####################
# Exercise 2
# #####################
# Write a Python program that converts temperatures to and from Celsius and Fahrenheit.
# Formulas:
# c = (5/9) * (f - 32)
# f = (9/5) * c + 32
# c = temperature in Celsius, f = temperature in Fahrenheit
# Example:
# Enter degrees in F or C: 70F
# 70F is equivalent to 21.1C
# Enter degrees in F or C: 12C
# 12C is equivalent to 53.6F


# #####################
# Exercise 3
# #####################
# Write a Python program that guesses a number between 1 and 15,
# where the user is asked to guess the number.
# As long as the user guesses the wrong number, a new attempt should be made.
# When the correct number is guessed, the program should print
# "Correct guess after X attempts!" where X is the number of attempts made.
# Example:
# Guess a number (1-15): 4
# Wrong number
# Guess a number: 7
# Correct guess after 2 attempts.

# Exercise 7
# #####################
# Write a Python program that asks for any word and prints it backwards.
# Example:
# Enter a word: Python
# Python backwards is nohtyP

# #####################
# Exercise 8
# #####################
# Write a Python program that counts the number of odd and even numbers
# in a list of integers.
# Example:
# The list (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) should give the output:
# Number of even numbers: 4
# Number of odd numbers: 5

# #####################
# Exercise 9
# #####################
# Write a Python program that uses the `continue` statement
# to print all the numbers from 0 to 10, except for the numbers 4 and 8.

# #####################
# Exercise 10
# #####################
# Write a Python program that prints the Fibonacci sequence between 0 and 100.
# The Fibonacci sequence is given by the following recursive relation:
# f_0 = 0
# f_1 = 1
# f_n = f_(n-1) + f_(n-2) for n >= 2
# The Fibonacci sequence is therefore 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

# #####################
# Exercise 11
# #####################
# Write a Python program that checks if an entered string is a valid password.
# The following conditions must be met:
# - Minimum length: 6 characters
# - Maximum length: 15 characters
# - At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
# - At least one number between [0-9].

# #####################
# Exercise 12
# #####################
# Write a Python program that determines if an entered letter is a vowel or a consonant.
# The program should handle both lowercase and uppercase letters.
# Example:
# Enter a letter: e
# e is a vowel.
# Enter a letter: K
# K is a consonant.

# #####################
# Exercise 13
# #####################
# Write a Python program that uses the `ord()` command to check
# if an entered string consists only of numbers.
# Example:
# Enter a string: 1234
# The string contains only numbers.
# Enter a string: 123ABC
# The string does not contain only numbers.

# #####################
# Exercise 14
# #####################
# Write a Python program that reads an integer representing a specific month
# and prints the month and the quarter in plain text.
# Example:
# Enter month (1-12): 10
# Month: October and fourth quarter.

# #####################
# Exercise 15
# #####################
# Write a Python program that calculates the median of three arbitrarily entered numbers.
# The median is the middle number when they are sorted in ascending order.
# Example:
# Enter the first number: 34
# Enter the second number: 12
# Enter the third number: 29
# The median is 29

# #####################
# Exercise 16
# #####################
# Write a Python program that calculates the sum and average of N numbers entered by the user.
# The number zero (0) ends the input.
# Example:
# Enter a number (end with 0): 14
# Enter a number (end with 0): 54
# Enter a number (end with 0): 32
# Enter a number (end with 0): 0
# The sum is 100.0 and the average is 33.3

# #####################
# Exercise 17
# #####################
# Write a Python program that creates the multiplication table from 1 to 10 for an entered number.
# Example:
# Enter an integer: 6
# 6 x 1 = 6
# 6 x 2 = 12
# 6 x 3 = 18
# 6 x 4 = 24
# 6 x 5 = 30
# 6 x 6 = 36
# 6 x 7 = 42
# 6 x 8 = 48
# 6 x 9 = 54
# 6 x 10 = 60
