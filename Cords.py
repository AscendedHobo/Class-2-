# #####################
# Write a Python program that guesses a number between 1 and 15,
# where the user is asked to guess the number.
# As long as the user guesses the wrong number, a new attempt should be made.
# When the correct number is guessed, the program should print
# "Correct guess after X attempts!" where X is the number of attempts made.
# Example:
# Guess a number (1-15): 4
# Wrong number
# Guess a number: 7
# Correct guess after 2 attempts.
