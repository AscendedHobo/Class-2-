PRACTICE: MCQUIZ

Write a Python program to play a multiple-choice quiz.

1. Set up a list of multiple-choice questions with 2, 3 or 4 possible answers.
1. You will also need some way of storing the correct answer.
2. From this list randomly select a question and its choices.
3. Display the question and choices and ask the user for their answer.
4. Check the userâ€™s answer, keeping score of correct and incorrect answers.
5. After 10 questions,
